# The Real Omnisearch, Python Style

- Use requests to send notes via pushbullet: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html
- Use GNTP to send grown notifications: https://github.com/kfdm/gntp/
- build array of patterns from patterns.txt (maybe take out comments from that file first)
- incorporate omnisearch.sh and cleanlog.py into one script
- call pdfgrep from within that script as per test.py
- ask for folio via applescript in similar manner
- run script from automator as python rather than calling python from bash - pass input as stdin
make sure env, path etc. calls python3 not built in 2.7

Aw yeah, this is gonna be awesome baby.
